Your task: Find me a product from the brand "{{ brand }}" that is a "{{ category }}".

I need the product title that is on a specific PRODUCT PAGE (PDP) from {{ brand }}'s official website.

Requirements:
- Product title must be from {{ brand }}'s official website
- URL should contain /products/ or /product/ in the path
- Include the citation for the PDP (not the category page, not the homepage, not the blog post) that contains the product title you found!
